# Managing Different Environments

Langfuse allows you to effectively manage various environments, such as production, staging, and development, either through projects or tags.

## Option 1: Projects

If you need to specify different [role-based access controls](/docs/rbac) for each environment, consider using separate projects for each environment. You can still group all environments within the same organization to simplify access management. Each project will have its own set of members, prompts, and API keys.

## Option 2: Tags

[Tags](/docs/tracing-features/tags) are a the preferred option if you don't have role-based access control requirements and want a consolidated view across all environments. Tags are fully supported across Langfuse features and make it easier to switch between different environments within the user interface and integrations as they share api keys, prompts, and members.
