We're thrilled to announce the launch of GJCLibrary 2.0, marking a significant evolution in our journey to modernize library management systems. Since our initial release, we've worked closely with librarians, students, and faculty members to understand their needs and challenges. Today, we're proud to present a comprehensive upgrade that transforms how academic libraries operate in the digital age.
