### PIN Authentication System (users_pincode)

#### Security Mechanisms
- **PIN Management**
  - Secure PIN storage
  - Regular rotation requirements
  - Complexity validation

- **Security Controls**
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Login Attempt] --> B{Verify PIN}
      B -->|Success| C[Grant Access]
      B -->|Fail| D[Increment Failed Count]
      D --> E{Check Failed Count}
      E -->|>3| F[Lock Account]
      E -->|â‰¤3| G[Allow Retry]
  ```

- **Security Features**
  - Failed attempt tracking
  - Automatic account locking
  - Token-based verification
  - Timestamp monitoring
  - Session management

### Best Practices
- Regular PIN updates required
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Rate limiting on attempts
- Audit logging of security events
