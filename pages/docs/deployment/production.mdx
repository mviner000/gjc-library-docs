# Deployment Environment Variables

This document outlines the environment variables specific to deploying Eyygo projects in a production environment, building upon the base environment variables.

## 📋 Sample Production Environment Variables

```dotenv
NODE_ENV=production
WS_PORT=3333
HTTP_PORT=80
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
CERT_FILE="/etc/ssl/certs/your_domain_name.crt"
KEY_FILE="/etc/ssl/private/your_domain_name.key"
LOG_FILE=/var/log/eyygo/server.log
DEBUG=false
TIME_ZONE=UTC
DB_ENGINE=postgresql
DB_NAME=eyygo_production
DB_USER=eyygo_user
DB_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
SECRET_KEY="long_random_string_here"
```

## 🔧 Production-Specific Configurations

### 🌍 Application Environment

#### NODE_ENV
- 🔢 **Value**: `production`
- 💡 **Tip**: Ensures the application runs in production mode with optimized settings.

### 🚪 Ports

#### HTTP_PORT
- 🎯 **Example**: `80`
- 💡 **Tip**: Typically set to 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS in production.

### 🔒 Security Settings

#### ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- 🎯 **Example**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- 💡 **Tip**: Only include trusted domains that need to access your API.

#### CERT_FILE and KEY_FILE
- 🎯 **Example**: 
  - CERT_FILE: `/etc/ssl/certs/your_domain_name.crt`
  - KEY_FILE: `/etc/ssl/private/your_domain_name.key`
- 💡 **Tip**: Ensure these point to valid SSL certificates for HTTPS.

#### SECRET_KEY
- 🎯 **Example**: `"long_random_string_here"`
- 💡 **Tip**: Use a long, random string. Never reuse development keys in production.

### 📊 Logging and Debugging

#### LOG_FILE
- 🎯 **Example**: `/var/log/eyygo/server.log`
- 💡 **Tip**: Use a path that's writable by your application process.

#### DEBUG
- 🔢 **Value**: `false`
- 💡 **Tip**: Disable in production to prevent exposing sensitive information.

#### TIME_ZONE
- 🎯 **Example**: `UTC`
- 💡 **Tip**: Use UTC in production for consistency across different server locations.

### 🗄️ Database Configuration

#### DB_ENGINE
- 🔢 **Value**: `postgresql`
- 💡 **Tip**: Use a robust, scalable database solution for production.

#### DB_NAME
- 🎯 **Example**: `eyygo_production`
- 💡 **Tip**: Use a clear, descriptive name for your production database.

#### DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT
- 💡 **Tip**: Use a dedicated database user with limited permissions. Store the password securely.

## 📌 Important Deployment Notes

- Never commit production environment variables to version control.
- Use a secrets management system or secure environment variable storage provided by your hosting platform.
- Regularly rotate secrets and update environment variables.
- Monitor your application logs and adjust settings as needed for optimal performance and security.
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest.

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. Set up your production environment with the necessary infrastructure.
2. Configure your environment variables securely on your production server or through your deployment platform.
3. Ensure all required services (database, web server, etc.) are properly set up and configured.
4. Deploy your application code to the production environment.
5. Verify that the application is using the correct production settings before going live.

Remember, protecting your production environment is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your Eyygo application. Always follow best practices for production deployments.
