# Environment Variables

This document serves as an index for the environment variable configurations used in Eyygo projects. It provides links to detailed documentation for base, development, and deployment configurations.

## ðŸ“‘ Configuration Files

1. [Base Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Settings.mdx)
   - Contains shared settings common to both development and production environments.
   - Provides a foundation for environment-specific configurations.

2. [Development Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Development.mdx)
   - Specific settings for local development environments.
   - Includes defaults optimized for debugging and ease of use.

3. [Deployment Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Production.mdx)
   - Production-ready settings for deploying Eyygo projects.
   - Focuses on security, performance, and scalability.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts

- **Base Configuration**: Defines the core set of environment variables used across all environments.
- **Development Configuration**: Builds upon the base, tailored for local development and debugging.
- **Deployment Configuration**: Extends the base with production-specific settings crucial for live deployments.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Begin by reviewing the [Base Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Settings.mdx) to understand the core environment variables.
2. For local development, refer to the [Development Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Development.mdx) and set up your `.env` file accordingly.
3. When preparing for deployment, consult the [Deployment Configuration](./Environment%20Variables/Production.mdx) to ensure your production environment is properly configured.

Remember to always keep your environment variables secure and never commit sensitive information to version control.
