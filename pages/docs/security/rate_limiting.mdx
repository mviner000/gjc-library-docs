# Rate Limiting

## Overview
The rate limiting system provides protection against abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window.

## Features
- URL pattern-based rate limiting
- Configurable request limits and time windows
- Automatic blocking of excessive requests
- Environment-specific configurations

## Configuration
```python
# Default rate limits
api/auth/: 5 requests per minute
api/*: 100 requests per minute
CSRF endpoints: Configurable via CSRF_RATE_LIMIT
```

## Implementation
The rate limiter uses Django's cache backend to track request counts per client and implements a sliding window algorithm.

```python
@rate_limit()
def your_view(request):
    # Your view logic here
    pass
```

## Best Practices
1. Set stricter limits for authentication endpoints
2. Use different limits for development and production
3. Monitor and log rate limit violations
4. Implement gradual backoff for blocked clients

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. Add Redis backend support for distributed setups
2. Implement rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)
3. Add burst allowance for legitimate traffic spikes
4. Implement IP-based rate limiting with subnet support
